Summary: 

R1: The function I wanted to test was the add_book_to_catalog to test if the web interface was correctly adding new books to the catalog, mainly obeying the requirements given, I tested the title length as well as the author length to check if an error would occer if the limit was passed. Also the ISBN making sure it was exactly 13 digits however I found that letters could also be used in the ISBN and pass as correct so that was the main error I found. Lastly testing the total copies value to ensure it was positive.

R2: This was more of a visual test as there was no function to be tested. A Visual Test done on the `http://localhost:5000` to ensure that the system displays all books in the catalog in a table format showing the following: Book ID, Title, Author, ISBN, Available copies / Total copies as well as the actions(Burrow Button). This was correctly implemented so it was deemed as sufficient.

R3: The only problem through my testing with this was that a patron was able to borrow any amount of books howeever their limit was only 5. I first tested everything else ensuring it was accepting the patron and book ID and validating the patron ID to borrow books. I also tested if the book was not found ensuring an error was thrown to ensure the proper messages were being displayed.

R4: The return_book_by_patron function was not implemented however I still wrote test cases to test it when it does get implemented. Ensuring thatsimilar to the borrow book function, the patron ID and book ID as were used as form parameters and I tested that the book was borrowed before and available copies were updated.

R5: The calculate_late_fee_for_book function was not implemented, the test cases I wrote were to test that the proper fees were being made for the proper amount of days the book was overdue. Also testing th maximum and ensuring a status is retuned if so.

R6: the search_books_in_catalog function was not implemented but I tested each search type to a search term and also the ISBN exact matching.

R7: the get_patron_status_report was not implemented. I still wrote test cases to see particular patrons' currently borrowed books, total late fees owed, number of books currently borrowed as well as borrow history to properly test each of these were properly reported to their patron ID.
